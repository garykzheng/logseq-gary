- ## Setting up a public site using Logseq
	- Welcome to my homepage! I'm using [Logseq](https://logseq.com/) and the [Logseq Publish Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/logseq-publish) from Github Marketplace and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for an easy way to manage the site.
